Please complete the below actions as soon as you can. Where you go on Monday morning depends on these steps!

1. Click [this link](http://garnet.wdidc.org/github/authorize?invite_code=14b71bca6df0c463f47f6e03742141e2). This will authorize you for Garnet, an application that both instructors and students will use to track your progress throughout WDI.
2. Update your GitHub profile with your full name and profile picture. The latter is very important - we need to know what you look like!
