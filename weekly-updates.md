    - Finding Your Voice & Defining Your Brand
    Your brand is your value proposition. It is important to understand who you are as a professional in your chosen field.      It is what makes you uniquely qualified over candidates who are just merely qualified based solely on hard skills. This      is what makes you different than any other candidates and allows you to stand out from the crowd. These differentiators,     when coupled with your hard skills, translate into employable skills that define you as a professional.
