# Homework

## General Guidelines
// TODO
- You will be given one or more assignments to finish by Wednesday at 9:00am, and one or more by Friday at 9:00am.
- Unless otherwise directed, each assignment should be forked and cloned from a `ga-dc` repository, and submitted as a pull request to the original `ga-dc` repository from your fork by 9:00am of the day on which it is due.
  - For instructions on pull requests, please see the [homework submission process documentation](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi7/blob/master/homework/submission-process.md)
// TODO
- Homework due Wednesday will be checked only for meaningful progress -- that is, for some substantial effort having been made to complete the assignment.
  - You can show meaningful progress without actually completing an assignment. The rubric is simply that you make an effort to complete it.
  - In general, feedback will not be given on these assignments by the grading instructor. That said, the grader will attempt to answer any questions you leave in your pull request, regarding your code, design choices, or the technologies involved.
    - **Please phrase all questions as a question, with a question mark (?).** This serves as a visual cue to the grader.
// TODO
- Homework due Friday will be graded on the same criteria as homework due Wednesday. The grader **will** leave meaningful feedback on these assignments. Leaving questions in your pull request is still extremely helpful as a way of informing the grader how they should target their feedback.

## Things to note
- We want to be able to give you some flexibility in your homework schedule.
- There will be roughly 2 hours of homework per night. Homework will take more time for some, and less time for others. It is up to you how you want to partition your time for a given exercise.
- These are the expectations that *we*, your instructors, set for you. But ultimately *you* decide is the best investment of your time and energy. Historically, the most successful students have completed most or all of the assignments.
- Please see the [main readme](readme.md) for incentives to complete your homework on-time!

## The submission process

All homework assignments will have their own Github repository, under the `ga-dc` account.

1. Please **fork** new assignments.
2. Then, **clone** your fork to your computer.
3. Create a feature branch in the format of `yourname_solution`
4. Complete your work inside it.
5. Then, **push** your completed work to your forked repository.
6. Finally, make a **pull request** to the upstream repository (in `ga-dc`).

**Even if you're not done, please make sure you've made a pull request with what you have completed by the times listed below.**

## What to include with your submission

On **every submission** -- that is, on every pull request (or, sometimes, issue) -- please include:
- **Comfort score**, out of 5
- **Completeness score**, out of 5
- On what **specific concept or piece of code** you would like feedback

We'd love to go through and add comments to your code in its entirety, but that's extremely time-consuming. Please let us know with what specific things you are most concerned and we'll focus our review there.

If you would like feedback on something that isn't working, please follow the format:

>I tried this:

>I expected this to happen:

>This happened instead: (**Include error messages**)


Finally, if you'd like feedback or an answer to a question from an instructor *other* than the one assigned to check your submission (see below), please include their first name in your pull request / issue.

## Due dates and grading

In general, there will be three due dates per week for homework:

// TODO
- Homework assigned Friday
  - **Due by:** Monday morning at 9:00am
  - **Graded by:** Robin
  - **Grades logged & feedback returned by:** Tuesday, 1:30pm
  - **Note:** These specific homeworks will be marked "Complete" simply if they are turned in and a cursory glance indicates some effort was made. On these assignments, comfort and completeness scores are required, but the feedback request is **optional**.


**Late homework will not be accepted**. We're flexible and accommodating. If you have issues submitting homework
please let us know. Otherwise late homework will not be accepted.
