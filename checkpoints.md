# Checkpoints

Here's a list of need to know concepts covered in each of the various weeks. Each week, we'll compile a list of everything we absolutely need to know moving forward as web developers. That is not to say that everything else we cover in class isn't important, but the things listed here are the absolute minimum requirements in order to be successful. If you find yourself looking over past weeks and are forgetting or misremembering a concept, you are highly encouraged to make sure to understand them throughout the entirety of the course(and as a developer).

## Week 1

### Javascript

- create an array stored to a variable
- create an object stored to a variable
- access values out of an array
- access values out of an object
- write a for loop
- use a loop to do something to each element of an array
- write an if/else conditional

### CLI && Git

- create a folder or file
- navigate your file system
- initialize git repo, make commits in git repo, use branches in git repo
- execute fork and pull model for git workflow (aka how to submit hw)

## Week 2

### DOM/jquery

- link script files to html
- load jQuery
- select elements in the DOM
- do things to jQuery objects like change css, text or html of an element
- get values from an input
- add an event listener to an element
- explain what a callback is

## Week 4

### Ruby

- Same programming fundamentals from week 1 for javascript only for ruby
- use the ruby `.each` method to iterate through a list and execute a block of code

### Ruby OOP
- Define a ruby class
- write an initialize method that sets instance variables
- create instances of an object using the `.new` method
- use `attr_accessor`, `attr_reader`, `attr_writer` to create getter/setter methods
- define an instance method
- define a class method
- write a ruby class that inherits from another class definition

### Active Record
- create and leverage a `Gemfile`
- link gem dependencies and other files in a ruby file
- create a database in postgres
- load a schema to a postgres database
- write a ruby class that inherits active record functionality
- write a ruby file that connects to a database
- use active record to do the following in a database:
  - create (`.create`, `.new`/`.save`)
  - read (`.all`, `.find`, `.find_by`, `.where`)
  - update (attr_accesors for columns, `.update`)
  - destroy (`.destroy`)
- leverage `has_many` and `belongs_to` helper methods to query databases and create data more effectively
- seed a database using a ruby program
