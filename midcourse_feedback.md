# Feedback Results

The instructional team wanted to provide you some takeaways that we garnered from the most recent feedback survey.

## Andy
- Slow down delivery
- be more aware of students keeping pace

## Nayana
- provide more real world examples
- sound more confident in class
- smoother pacing in lectures

## James
- Provide opportunities for students to redirect me to re-cover concepts or explain concepts in greater detail
- Provide more code snippets from the wild, incorporate industry practices
- Be less tentative in leading the class

## Overarching
### Homework Feedback
There's been a slight miss step in providing prompt and meaningful feedback. We would like to make sure you guys do get this. Unfortunately we don't have the time to provide feedback for every assignment. To that end:

- We will continue to provide feedback for 1 homework assignment and the lab per week(unchanged)
- We will maintain an expectation that no more than 2 days will pass without making sure we do checks for completion on homework
- We will ensure that, even if only graded for completion, we will make sure to address any comments posted in homework feedback
- For graded assignments we will provide feedback within 3 business days of turn in.
- We will grade projects within 1 week of turn in.

Though this is not ideal, the instructors have many responsibilities and will do our best to try and get feedback to students sooner.

### Calendar

The calendar isn't perfect. But it's been working far better than what we used to use(google calendars, yuck!). We actually got a lot of positive feedback for it, but also received feedback for points of improvement. That said:

- We will *try* to make sure the calendar is 100% good to go on Monday for that week.
- Note though that things may arise with which we use our discretion to help facilitate.

### Review

There's been a lot of requests for review sessions. As a result we will be offering a 1 hour review session every Friday starting this week. This review session is entirely optional, but welcome all!

### Final Remarks
If there's anything that hasn't been mentioned, please feel free to contact any of the instructors or Brian to help address these things. Last but not least, a super thank you for all the feedback and being such an awesome class!
