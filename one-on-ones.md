They're a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-ones might include:
- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!

One-on-ones are usually 30 minutes. They can be longer or shorter depending on what needs you express.

We're **more than happy** to meet with you outside of the scheduled one-on-one times! Please just ask, either in-person or via Slack. You can request time from *any* instructor. If we can fit it into our schedules, we'll make it work!
