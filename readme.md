- Tips
  - `@here`: Sends a message to everyone currently online in a Slack room
  - \`hello\`: Backtics (the top-left of the keyboard on a Mac) makes text show up in a monospace font. Great for code.
  - ```
    ` ` `
    A row of 3 backtics on either end of text makes it show up as a block of monospaced code.
    The backtics must be on a row by themselves.
    ` ` `
    ```
